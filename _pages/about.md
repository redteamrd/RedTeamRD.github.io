Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Examples of included layouts `splash`, `single`, and `archive`." %}

## Notable Features

- Bundled as a "theme gem" for easier install/upgrading.
- Compatible with GitHub Pages.
- Support for Jekyll's built-in Sass/SCSS preprocessor.
- Nine different skins (color variations).
